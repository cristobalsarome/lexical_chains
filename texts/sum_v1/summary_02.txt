The Cabuliwallah is a Classic Story.I really believe that in all her life she has not wasted a minute in silence.I was hard at work on my seventeenth chapter, where Protrap Singh, the hero, had just caught Kanchanlata, the heroine, in his arms, and was about to escape with her by the third story window of the castle, when all of a sudden Mini left her play, and ran to the window, crying, "A Cabuliwallah!One morning, however, not many days later, as I was leaving the house, I was startled to find Mini, seated on a bench near the door, laughing and talking, with the great Cabuliwallah at her feet.In all her life, it appeared; my small daughter had never found so patient a listener, save her father.For the Cabuliwallah had given it to Mini, and her mother catching sight of the bright round object, had pounced on the child with: "Where did you get that eight-anna bit?"I, entering at the moment, saved her from impending disaster, and proceeded to make my own inquiries.It was not the first or second time, I found, that the two had met.Then the Cabuliwallah, not to be behindhand, would take his turn: "Well, little one, and when are you going to the father-in-law's house?"Now most small Bengali maidens have heard long ago about the father-in-law's house; but we, being a little new-fangled, had kept these things from our child, and Mini at this question must have been a trifle bewildered.These were autumn mornings, the very time of year when kings of old went forth to conquest; and I, never stirring from my little corner in Calcutta, would let my mind wander over the whole world.At the very name of another country, my heart would go out to it, and at the sight of a foreigner in the streets, I would fall to weaving a network of dreams, --the mountains, the glens, and the forests of his distant home, with his cottage in its setting, and the free and independent life of far-away wilds.Perhaps the scenes of travel conjure themselves up before me, and pass and repass in my imagination all the more vividly, because I lead such a vegetable existence, that a call to travel would fall upon me like a thunderbolt.In the presence of this Cabuliwallah, I was immediately transported to the foot of arid mountain peaks, with narrow little defiles twisting in and out amongst their towering heights.I could see--but at some such point Mini's mother would intervene, imploring me to "beware of that man."Whenever she hears a noise in the street, or sees people coming towards the house, she always jumps to the conclusion that they are either thieves, or drunkards, or snakes, or tigers, or malaria or cockroaches, or caterpillars, or an English sailor.Even after all these years of experience, she is not able to overcome her terror.So she was full of doubts about the Cabuliwallah, and used to beg me to keep a watchful eye on him.I tried to laugh her fear gently away, but then she would turn round on me seriously, and ask me solemn questions.Was it so very absurd that this big man should be able to carry off a tiny child?As it was indefinite, however, it did not seem right to forbid the man the house, and the intimacy went on unchecked.Once a year in the middle of January Rahmun, the Cabuliwallah, was in the habit of returning to his country, and as the time approached he would be very busy, going from house to house collecting his debts.This year, however, he could always find time to come and see Mini.It would have seemed to an outsider that there was some conspiracy between the two, for when he could not come in the morning, he would appear in the evening.Even to me it was a little startling now and then, in the corner of a dark room, suddenly to surprise this tall, loose-garmented, much bebagged man; but when Mini would run in smiling, with her, "O!and the two friends, so far apart in age, would subside into their old laughter and their old jokes, I felt reassured.One morning, a few days before he had made up his mind to go, I was correcting my proof sheets in my study.Through the window the rays of the sun touched my feet, and the slight warmth was very welcome.It was almost eight o'clock, and the early pedestrians were returning home, with their heads covered.All at once, I heard an uproar in the street, and, looking out, saw Rahmun being led away bound between two policemen, and behind them a crowd of curious boys.Partly from one, partly from another, I gathered that a certain neighbour had owed the pedlar something for a Rampuri shawl, but had falsely denied having bought it, and that in the course of the quarrel, Rahmun had struck him.Now in the heat of his excitement, the prisoner began calling his enemy all sorts of names, when suddenly in a verandah of my house appeared my little Mini, with her usual exclamation: "O Cabuliwallah!He had no bag under his arm today, so she could not discuss the elephant with him.She at once therefore proceeded to the next question: "Are you going to the father-in-law's house?"Then seeing that the reply did not amuse the child, he held up his fettered hands. "Ali," he said, " I would have thrashed that old father-in-law, but my hands are bound!"On a charge of murderous assault, Rahmun was sentenced to some years'imprisonment.Time passed away, and he was not remembered.The accustomed work in the accustomed place was ours, and the thought of the once-free mountaineer spending his years in prison seldom or never occurred to us.Even my light-hearted Mini, I am ashamed to say, forgot her old friend.New companions filled her life.As she grew older, she spent more of her time with girls.So much time indeed did she spend with them that she came no more, as she used to do, to her father's room.I was scarcely on speaking terms with her.Years had passed away.It was to take place during the Puja Holidays.With Durga returning to Kailas, the light of our home also was to depart to her husband's house, and leave her father's in the shadow.After the rains, there was a sense of ablution in the air, and the sun-rays looked like pure gold.So bright were they that they gave a beautiful radiance even to the sordid brick walls of our Calcutta lanes.Since early dawn to-day the wedding-pipes had been sounding, and at each beat my own heart throbbed.The wail of the tune, Bhairavi, seemed to intensify my pain at the approaching separation.From early morning noise and bustle had pervaded the house.In the courtyard the canopy had to be slung on its bamboo poles; the chandeliers with their tinkling sound must be hung in each room and verandah.There was no end of hurry and excitement.I was sitting in my study, looking through the accounts, when some one entered, saluting respectfully, and stood before me.He had no bag, nor the long hair, nor the same vigour that he used to have."Last evening," he said, "I was released from jail."The words struck harsh upon my ears.I had never before talked with one who had wounded his fellow, and my heart shrank within itself, when I realised this, for I felt that the day would have been better-omened had he not turned up.Could you perhaps come another day?"At once he turned to go; but as he reached the door he hesitated, and said: "May I not see the little one, sir, for a moment?"It was his belief that Mini was still the same.In fact, in memory of former days he had brought, carefully wrapped up in paper, a few almonds and raisins and grapes, obtained somehow from a countryman, for his own little fund was dispersed.I said again: "There is a ceremony in the house, and you will not be able to see any one to-day."The man's face fell.He looked wistfully at me for a moment, said "Good morning," and went out.He came close up to me holding out his offerings and said: "I brought these few things, sir, for the little one.I took them and was going to pay him, but he caught my hand and said: "You are very kind, sir!Do not offer me money!--You have a little girl, I too have one like her in my own home.I think of her, and bring fruits to your child, not to make a profit for myself."Saying this, he put his hand inside his big loose robe, and brought out a small and dirty piece of paper.With great care he unfolded this, and smoothed it out with both hands on my table.It bore the impression of a little band.Not a photograph.Not a drawing.The impression of an ink-smeared hand laid flat on the paper.This touch of his own little daughter had been always on his heart, as he had come year after year to Calcutta, to sell his wares in the streets.Tears came to my eyes.He also was a father.That impression of the hand of his little Parbati in her distant mountain home reminded me of my own little Mini.The Cabuliwallah looked a little staggered at the apparition.At last he smiled and said: "Little one, are you going to your father-in-law's house?"But Mini now understood the meaning of the word "father-in-law," and she could not reply to him as of old.She flushed up at the question, and stood before him with her bride-like face turned down.I remembered the day when the Cabuliwallah and my Mini had first met, and I felt sad.When she had gone, Rahmun heaved a deep sigh, and sat down on the floor.The idea had suddenly come to him that his daughter too must have grown in this long time, and that he would have to make friends with her anew.And besides, what might not have happened to her in these eight years?The marriage-pipes sounded, and the mild autumn sun streamed round us.But Rahmun sat in the little Calcutta lane, and saw before him the barren mountains of Afghanistan.I took out a bank-note, and gave it to him, saying: "Go back to your own daughter, Rahmun, in your own country, and may the happiness of your meeting bring good fortune to my child!"I could not have the electric lights I had intended, nor the military band, and the ladies of the house were despondent at it.But to me the wedding feast was all the brighter for the thought that in a distant land a long-lost father met again with his only child.
