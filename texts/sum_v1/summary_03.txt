Chloe arrived home from school, made herself a cup of coffee and took it up to her bedroom.She wanted to enjoy the quiet hour before her parents arrived home and the house filled up with the evening sounds of chatter, television or her dad listening to his beloved jazz while he cooked dinner.'... they must live in your room and never go to other parts of the house, especially not the kitchen'.Mum laughed, and two days later they went to Martin's house to collect Roxy and Zena.First she picked up Roxy and put her on the floor.Then she picked up Zena and put her on her shoulder.She climbed up Chloe's bookcases and drawers and went under her bed.Zena was quieter and was usually content to sit on Chloe's shoulder while Chloe messaged her friends or read a book.Dad's on his way home.Roxy always came when Chloe said her name.Chloe waited a moment and then started to look around her room.She had to be in Chloe's room somewhere.Then Chloe remembered that Mum had come in and opened the door.Roxy might have gone out of the room then and now she could be anywhere.Chloe searched the top floor of the house first.She looked in her parents' room and the bathroom, but she couldn't see Roxy anywhere.Then she headed downstairs to the kitchen, hoping she'd find Roxy munching on a carrot or snacking on crumbs.Chloe ran the last few steps to the kitchen and breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the washing machine door was open with no sign of Roxy inside.Chloe then searched the rest of the kitchen, looking in drawers and opening cupboards, calling Roxy's name as she did so.said Dad's voice and she turned around to see him coming into the kitchen with a bag of food from the Italian Delicatessen.Different voices spoke inside her head.said one voice.said another, so Chloe decided to take a chance.'I see,' said Dad, putting down the shopping bag, and already beginning to scan the kitchen for the sight of a nose and whiskers or a long pink tail.Chloe and her dad spent a frantic half hour looking all over the house for Roxy.When she was searching her room for the third time, Chloe heard a key in the door and Mum calling, 'It's me, I'm home'.Mum wasn't going to be happy about having a rat loose in the house.She decided to stay in her room and let Dad tell Mum about Roxy.She went downstairs and there was Mum with a smile on her face and Roxy on her shoulder.'Well, when I got to the gym,' said Mum, 'I opened my bag and found Roxy asleep in one of my trainers.'No, it was a shock but I touched her and picked her up for the first time and you know what?
