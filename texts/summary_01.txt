It’s not only pirates in stories who go hunting for buried treasure.Unlike pirate treasure in stories, there’s no map to follow.Treasure hunters spend ages in internet chat rooms discussing the meaning of every word in the six-verse poem and looking for extra clues in Forrest’s two books about his life.Others look for a more poetic meaning, for example a person’s tears could be warm water.Brown might be a person because names usually start with a capital letter.So maybe you have to look for people called Brown who live in the Rocky Mountains.You can see why people spend a long time analysing the poem, can’t you?Forrest advises people to wait until spring to avoid dangerous winter weather and he says people shouldn’t go alone.Three people have gone missing while looking for the treasure.Police who work in the area wish Forrest would call off the hunt so no more people die.He says he’s extremely sad about any loss of life, but he points out that ‘if someone drowns in the swimming pool we shouldn’t empty the pool, we should teach people to swim’.He wants people to learn about nature and how to hike and hunt in the woods.A big part of his reason for hiding the treasure is that he thinks people spend too much time inside their houses, sitting in offices or playing on computers and phones.He remembers his own childhood adventures in the Rocky Mountains and he wants families to have those adventures together too.We saw some bears but our dog scared them away before I had to shoot them with my gun.We couldn’t even light the fire.’
Some treasure hunters have been out looking for the chest too many times to count.Marti and her daughter Libbi travel from their home in Georgia to search in Montana.Libbi says: ‘The thought of bears around every corner was a horrible fear for the first two years, but you slowly get over the fear of animals.It’s all so exciting, even if we never find the treasure.’
But there are people who think the whole thing is a hoax.Others say he retrieved it years ago.Unless someone finds the treasure, we won’t know if it really is hidden.But even the people who complain it’s a hoax are often still out in the Rocky Mountains testing their ideas.Often they’re so sure they’re right this time that they say it’s a hoax just because they’re angry their idea didn’t lead them to the treasure.Of course, one possibility is that someone has already found the treasure and not told anyone.But that won’t stop hundreds more people going treasure hunting this spring.
